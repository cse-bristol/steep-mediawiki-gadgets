* Bristol Smart Energy Wiki

This is a deployment of the STEEP Stakeholder engagement platform.

See the master branch for the main readme contents.

It is owned by Simon Roberts at CSE, who still wants it to live for now. Check with him again in 2019 about both this and the London Smart Energy wiki.

** Live Server

Hosted on Linode, it can be accessed at https://bristol-smart-energy.cse.org.uk/.

It is backed up daily onto Linode.

** Credentials

The following are available in the CSE password database:
 + Server root password
 + Password for wiki 'admin' user
 + MySQL root password
 + Mediawiki root password
 + An HTML Basic login which is no longer required (anyone can view this wiki now)

** Differences from STEEP

This wiki's initial setup is identical to the main STEEP wiki, except that:
 + Left out the STEEP project view extension that we made.
 + Swapped EU and STEEP logos for Bristol logos.
 + Asked for less information when you sign up for an account.
