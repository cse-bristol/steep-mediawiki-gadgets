* VisualEditor Extension
** Resize/Move
After inserting a process-model or map, it would be useful to be able to arrange it on the page.

See [[https://doc.wikimedia.org/VisualEditor/master/#!/api/ve.dm.ResizableNode][ve.dm.ResizableNode]] and [[https://doc.wikimedia.org/VisualEditor/master/#!/api/ve.ce.ResizableNode][ve.ce.ResizableNode]].

** Iframe Reloading
There is very frequent iframe reloading in VisualEditor. This is slow and annoying.

It would be useful if we could reduce the amount that this happens:
 + Sometimes the =src= property didn't even really change. Can we somehow buffer this?
 + When we set the viewpoint, we don't really need to reload the iframe. We only need to mark it on the model.

* Skin
** Manage Assets Page
This was designed, but never implemented due to lack of time.

It should be a table listing all the process-models, maps, map layers and files wchih exist, regardless of project.

** Map Layers as Assets
We haven't done any design for this yet.

It will also require changes to the map itself, which currently automatically uploads layers to the server. It should present the user with an extra upload dialogue on save instead.

** Icons per file type
When displaying files in the wiki, if they are of a known type (based on extension? MIME type?), we should display the icons which were made for them in the Steep skin.

** Search
This applies to the main search page (type something in the search bar and press enter straight away) and the special search bars for projects.

These should be able to show process-models, maps and map layers.

** Watch/Unwatch
The watch/unwatch buttons are being controlled by Mediawiki's own JavaScript. As well as doing the action, this also modifies the HTML in ways that don't make sense for our skin.

We should replace the HTMl changing side-effect with one which works better for our skin.

* Deployment
** Move Extension Code
The VisualEditor extension code should have its own folder.

We could put it directly inside the =/mediawiki= folder, and then add an extra symlink to put the VisualEditor extension into =/mediawiki/extensions=. 

** Access Control
Read and write restrictions with at least project-level control.

We were considering using [[http://wiki.4intra.net/IntraACL][IntraACL]], but it doesn't yet support Mediawiki 1.25.

** Backup/Restore
The backup and restore functions were designed when we were using MongoDB as a backend.

They need replacing to work with ElasticSearch instead.

*** Implementation Notes
path.repo: ["/mount/backups", "/mount/longterm_backups"] in the elasticsearch.yml file.

First register a repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC js2
  // PUT /_snapshot/my_backup
  var thing = {
      "type": "fs",
      "settings": {
          compress: true,
          location: "/somewhere"
      }
  };

#+END_SRC

Then add a snapshot:
#+BEGIN_SRC js2
  // PUT /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot
  var thing = {
      indices: 'share',
      ignore_unavailable: false,
      include_global_state: false,
      partial: false,
      wait_for_completion: true
  };
#+END_SRC

We can do POST /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1/_restore
